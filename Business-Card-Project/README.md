# Business Card Project

This is a beginner-friendly HTML and CSS project where we create a simple business card.  
The goal is to practice the steps a real developer would take when building something:  
planning, researching, designing, and then coding.

## Project Structure

---

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Make sure the `style.css` file is in the same folder.
3. Any changes you make in the HTML or CSS can be saved and refreshed in the browser.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to separate structure (HTML) and style (CSS).
- Learn how to use **flexbox** for layout.
- Practice using **CSS variables** for colors.
- Practice linking an external stylesheet.
- Document what you research as you go.

## Steps We Followed

1. **Plan**

   - Decided what information goes on the card (name, title, email, phone).
   - Sketched a simple layout on paper.

2. **Research**

   - Looked up flexbox basics, CSS variables, and how to center items on a page.
   - Wrote down resources and what we learned from them.

3. **Design**

   - Picked a color palette and applied it to different parts of the card.

4. **Build**

   - Created the `index.html` file with semantic HTML.
   - Styled it step by step in `style.css`.

5. **Test & Debug**

   - Opened in browser, fixed spacing and alignment issues.

6. **Reflect**
   - Wrote down what we learned and what questions we still have.

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add hover effects for the contact info.
